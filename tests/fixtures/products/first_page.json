It exists as two enantiomers or stereoisomers R-  -lipoic acid  RLA  and S- - -lipoic acid  SLA . It is produced in small amounts in the liver and other body tissues, where it is needed by enzymes to catalyze numerous essential chemical reactions in the body. For instance, ALA is essential inside the mitochondria of cells, where it is needed to metabolize glucose and direct calories into energy production.</p><p>ALA is considered to be a multimodal supplement because, aside from its enzymatic role in energy production, it acts by multiple mechanisms and displays diverse health-enhancing and antioxidant properties. Recently discovered is ALAs ability to regulate several genes linked to cell survival and oxidative stress. Therefore, in addition to its enzymatic role, ALA is a powerful antioxidant and performs a number of other vital functions related to its ability to modify the expression of various genes.

Folic acid intake is important for pregnant women and helps promote heart health.* Folic acid helps maintain healthy levels of homocysteine by helping convert homocysteine into methionine.* In addition, it plays a significant role in the health of red blood cells, and helps support a healthy nervous system. Adequate folate in healthful diets may reduce a womans risk of having a child with a brain or spinal cord birth defect.
